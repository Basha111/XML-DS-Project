# XML-DS-Project
## XML 
An Extensible Markup Language (XML) file is a file used to store data in the form of hierarchical elements. Data stored in XML files can be read by computer programs with the help of custom tags, which indicate the type of element. It is one of the most famous formats for storing and sharing information among different devices. The thing that differentiates XML, though, is that it’s extensible. XML doesn’t have a predefined markup language, like HTML does. Instead, XML allows users to create their own markup symbols to describe content, making an unlimited and self-defining symbol set.
## Json 
JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a standard text-based format for representing structured data based on JavaScript object syntax. It is commonly used for transmitting data in web applications (e.g., sending some data from the server to the client, so it can be displayed on a web page, or vice versa), data in a machine-readable way. 
## Social Networks
As Networks are around us we will use the xml to represent the social network using graph data structure as it will be helpful to extract some useful information like who is most influencer?, who is most active user?, also know mutual followers between users and suggest users to other ones and finally search for a word or a topic in the posts and know the publisher.
## Objectives
In this project, we will learn how to understand and parse XML and json files. Additionally, we
will work on designing a GUI (Graphical User Interface) to visualize XML and json files. we
should also work on designing the program such that it makes use of optimal data structures for the implemented features.

## Functionalities of the Project
 ### Check Consistency  
 After taking the xml fron the user 
  - it will show the positions of the errors in the xml file or show that the xml file has no errors.
  - Correct the error: it will correct the errors if exists.
  - Show xml file: show the original xml file if the user need to compare the original file and the modified file.

 
 ### Convert to Json
 As json file are important, we will cover how to convert from xml to json file
 
 ### Data Compression and Decompression
  - we will minify(remove the spaces and new lines from the xml file) to reduce the size of the file.
  - Compress: using Huffman method, it compress the file and show the result to the user and comparing the original size and the reduced one
  - Decompress: it returns the xml file to its original text with the original size and show it to the user.
 
 
 ### Graph Representation
   - Show most influencer: it shows the user that has most followers
   - Show most active user: it shows the user thar has large following list.
   - Mutual followers between users: it leads you to screen where you enter the id of the two users and will show the common followers between them.
   - Suggestion list for each user: it will show the followers of the of the followers for each user.
   - Search for a word: it leads you to screen where you enter a word and it will shows the posts or the topics that word exist in.
